# Emotion-Enhanced PDF Narrator with Person and Place Recognition

## Overview

The Emotion-Enhanced PDF Narrator is a web application designed to revolutionize PDF interaction. By integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, this tool provides an immersive reading experience. It identifies persons and places within PDF documents, performs sentiment analysis to classify emotional content, and generates dynamic audio narration that reflects the documentâ€™s emotional tone.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload PDF files through a simple interface.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and displays names of persons and places within the document.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts text into spoken words with emotion-based modulation.
- **Progress Indicator**: Displays a progress bar while generating the audio.
- **Audio Playback**: Plays the generated audio directly in the web interface.
